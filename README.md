## Introduction

This is a project to create a proper Raspberry Pi based Smartphone. Inspired by Dave Hunt's first attempt a few years ago, Rishi Raj started on this project in late 2016. Nikola and Dharshan then joined shortly after to help build the phone. The aim of this project is to create a elegant, compact smartphone device using the Raspberry Pi Zero, Adafruit FONA, and other components. 

## Current Progress

Right now, the project is mainly in the software backend phase. Basic calling and texting through the FONA has been implemented. The team has also been implemnted basic Kivy UI screens to some apps. 

## Near Future

The team hopes to get all the features of calling and texting done soon. The UI for the camera, calling, and texting app will be created. UI protoypes for the home screen are done and work to implement it is underway. 

## Final Goal

The plan is to have a fully fledged smartphone with a 3D printed case done by the end of Summer 2017. 

## Planned features
- Place outgoing calls and recieve incoming calls
- Integrated small electret microphone and speaker. Speaker may be surface transducer based
- Take pictures and video with the integreated Raspberry Pi V2 camera, 8MP and 1080p video
- 5 inch 800x480 pixel screen with resistive touch. Although multi-touch is not possible, many one finger based gestures will still be implemented to the phone. Such as swiping, sliding, scrolling, etc
- 2500-3000mAH battery. Battery life is estimated to be 3-4 hours while active, 16 hours standby
- 3D printed case made of ABS plastic and stainless steel. The final phone will have a polished steel finish. 
- Under 15mm thickness. Should be able to fit in a pocket and look elegant while in public use
- Custom Operating System Aviary will come with many modern smartphone features and apps
- Base apps will include: Phone, Texting, Contacts, Camera, Gallery, Music Player, Settings, and Internet Broswer
- OS functions will include and notification bar on top with cell signal strength, battery remaining, time, app notifications 
- On screen home button will be used to close apps. Holding down home button will open multitasking. The home button area will also house contextual buttons for apps.
