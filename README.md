Authors: Rishi Raj, Nikola Ištvanić, Dharshan Ram

## Introduction

This is a project to create a proper Raspberry Pi based Smartphone. Inspired by Dave Hunt's first attempt a few years ago, Rishi Raj started on this project in late 2016. Nikola and Dharshan then joined shortly after to help build the phone. The aim of this project is to create a elegant, compact smartphone device using the Raspberry Pi Zero, Adafruit FONA, and other components. 

## Current Progress

Right now, the project is mainly in the software backend phase. Basic calling and texting through the FONA has been implemented. The team has also been implemnted basic Kivy UI screens to some apps. 

## Near Future

The team hopes to get all the features of calling and texting done soon. The UI for the camera, calling, and texting app will be created. UI protoypes for the home screen are done and work to implement it is underway. 

## Final Goal

The plan is to do a fully fledged smartphone with a 3D printed case done by the end of Summer 2017.
